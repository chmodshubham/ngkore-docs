# NgKore Documentation

## Overview

NgKore Foundation (_ngkorefoundation.org_) is an open-source community advancing research and development in next-generation network infrastructure, quantum-resistant cryptography, and cloud-native architectures. The foundation focuses on bridging academic research with production-ready implementations across telecommunications, distributed systems, and emerging network technologies.
